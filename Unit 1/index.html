	<h1>About Me</h1>

<p> I am an account coordinator living in Portland, Oregon. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I am interested in design and learning to code. I am also hoping this will help to differentiate me in the job market.</p> 

<h2>My Mission</h2>

<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as the head of North America Public Relations at Pinterest because I would like to work in a fast-paced, creative and supportive environment.</p> 

<h2>My Experience</h2>
