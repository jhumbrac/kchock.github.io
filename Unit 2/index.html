	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
		<p>The websites I was most inspired by are:</p> 
		<ul>
			<li><ahref="http://salleedesign.com/home/"> http://salleedesign.com/home/</a> (a design portfolio of a man named Jeremy Sallee)</li><li><ahref="http://www.castirondesign.com/company/"> http://www.castirondesign.com/company/</a>(a professional website of a design company).</li> 
	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
		<p>Sallee created a balanced portfolio layout. The size of the various components indicate levels of importance. The header image is big and bold whereas his contact information is rather small. Each paragraph or section of copy is very spaced out to help with readability. He is also relatively consistent with breaks using horizontal lines to separate sections.</p> 
		<p>The Cast Iron Design Company created all of its graphics are around the same size, which helps with flow. The lines and orientation of the graphics add to the flow because they guide your eyes. There is pretty good balance because the website has a column template.</p>  
	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
		<p>The portfolio emphasizes white space. The text is always left justified but centered within the columns. He leaves a good deal of white space on both sides of the screen and even when there are multiple columns there is a good deal of space between the text of either column, only the photographs touch.</p> 
		<p>The Cast Iron Design also emphasizes columns. But leaves space between graphics. There is an emphasis on sectioning content on both websites. In addition to columns, Sallee uses lines to break up the page horizontally and Cast Iron uses boxes as well as lines.</p>
	<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
		<p>These three thumbnail sketches represent three tabs on my online portfolio.</p> 
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Home Page</strong><br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nbp8JVfTqLNDJzHC728M2v7VIsq5umr2Dy_yImR5HFnIMaMKl6bqYqWWRChSTf-MKXYwnAWjHB4=w1256-h400" alt="Home Page Sketch"></li> 
		<p>I wanted a simple home page so I kept it fairly simple. I hve sketched out the menu header, the hero photo and a short description of the website. The hero image is the focal point and its framed by white space. The hero image is the most important so it is the largest. In terms of balance, the width of the header, image and the copy will be the same.</p>
		<li><strong>Bio</strong><br><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/sBwRnh0oEo_nrio42RvKUEha315mQokgFL9uV3HLOUSxxcaurWzMzqTGZL9orivpPVQ0DZVLTFw=w1256-h400" alt="Bio sketch"></li></li> 
		<p>This sketch represents my bio page. It has the same header as the home page and also has a photo focal point. To ensure balance, I used a column layout. The copy will take up two columns and the picture will take up one.</p> 
		<li><strong>Work Samples</strong><br><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ttaxs7VcoiMv_FVJe76Df1v6A8GA9NsGxb_Y7KIEy4qUpDgl8C0AIXvu-Ec1XHa1NsvA5e_5Dzg=w1256-h400" alt="Portfolio page"></li>
		<p>This is a sketch of my work samples page. Similar to the bio page, it has a three column layout. All of the photos are the same size because each visual is equally important.</p> 
</ul>
